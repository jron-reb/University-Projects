## Stock Market Analysis (Python, Scikit-learn, Data Science)
The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges are close in geography and therefore linked with one another, with arbitrage between the 2 exchanges being commonplace. This coursework was the analysis of the data of these markets and extracting trends that could be applied to make a profit.
These trends were found using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. An algorithm was first trained and then tested using scikit-learn. An analysis was then conducted on these trends.

## Multi-threading with OpenMP (High Performance Computing C++)
Simulating the particle diffusion using a step wise solution. Multi-threading using OpenMP to coordinate the threads was used due to the high number of calculations. The math also had to be done, with the correct limits and boundaries set. This was to introduce high performance computing on a dataset where such computing power was necesaary. This was done in order to share the strengths and weaknesses of high performance computing and see how to create a real life implementation.

## Song finding and storage (MicroService implementation Golang)
This coursework was similar to how shazam functions. A Base64 encoded .wav music file was submitted via a curl request. This was then used to find the full song using an alternate service's API. 
The songs could then be stored, retrieved and deleted in a local database. It was impemented in multiple different micro services in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of such an implementation. Each function had a different microservice. In this case 1 function was interacting with the database. Another was the searching of the songs from the snippets. The final microservice was tying the tie different microservices together and handling any other interactions with the third party service.
(MS, music searcher also had SQL) CHECK WHERE THE DB WAS ACTUALLY STORED IN THE END

## Quickhull Implementation and Time & Space Complexity analysis (Python)
This coursework required an implementation of a famous algorithm. I chose quickhull because of its relation to the computer graphics module I was taking simultaneously.
There was also a time and space complexity analysis as well as a discussion on how different implementations would/wouldnt affect this.

## Final Coursework Submission for Object Oriented Programming (Java)
This coursework was to create the backend of a social media platform. This included adding and creating users and the normal functionality that comes with a social media platform such as adding, removing, commenting, sharing and liking posts.
The purpose of this coursework was to use object oriented programming in a wider scope project and see how it can fit with other aspects of programming.

## Initial Coursework for Object Oriented Programming (Java)
This coursework was to create a room booking system to allow for covid friendly working. This allowed for the creation and deletion of rooms as well as the booking of rooms. This was to give an introduction to Object Oriented Programming.

## Covid Case Tracker (Web Development, CSS, JavaScript, SQL)
This coursework was to make a website to allow users to register with the tracker and login and see exactly on a map where people were infected with covid or are currently isolating. It also allows users to put in their own information on where and when they were infected. 
This was to create a website from the frontend, to securing the inputs to managing the database and dealing with storing the location data.


# Year 2 Projects

##Haskell Coursework

This was to create a low level compiler in Haskell. This allowed the user to store and remove values. It allowed the comparison of those values and was able to complete further operations based on the comparisons. It was also able to take in a queue of instructions involving these comparisons, storage and removal of values as well as a jump operation allowing skipping of these values if necessary.
This was to cement the knowledge on functional programming and how it can be used.

## Software Development coursework
This was to create a game where players would select pebbles with a number on them and win based on the sum. The goal was to use multi-threading to do so and in get an introduction to parallel computing.

## C++ Coursework (traffic light simulation)
This was to create a simulation of roadworks and keep track of how long each car would have to wait on each side of the roadworks based on the frequency of cars arriving and the length each traffic light was red. 
An analysis then had to be conducted. This was to get an introduction of C and a more real life application of how pointers can be used than D&S courseworks.
