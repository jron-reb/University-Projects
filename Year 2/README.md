# Year 2 Projects

##Haskell Coursework

This was to create a low level compiler in Haskell. This allowed the user to store and remove values. It allowed the comparison of those values and was able to complete further operations based on the comparisons. It was also able to take in a queue of instructions involving these comparisons, storage and removal of values as well as a jump operation allowing skipping of these values if necessary.
This was to cement the knowledge on functional programming and how it can be used.

## Software Development coursework
This was to create a game where players would select pebbles with a number on them and win based on the sum. The goal was to use multi-threading to do so and in get an introduction to parallel computing.

## C++ Coursework (traffic light simulation)
This was to create a simulation of roadworks and keep track of how long each car would have to wait on each side of the roadworks based on the frequency of cars arriving and the length each traffic light was red. 
An analysis then had to be conducted. This was to get an introduction of C and a more real life application of how pointers can be used than D&S courseworks.
